# Consolpunke Specs

Consolpunke is a text-based social platform for developers. This repository contains
the specifications which describe the protocols used between the client and the server
of the platform, as well as details on the overall architecture. They are documented
here in the hope that we'll have a variety of clients in a variety of languages.
